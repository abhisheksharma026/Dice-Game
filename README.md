# Dice-Game
Dice Simulation

##### Project Overview :

In this series of three programming tasks, we will implement together a program that will play optimally in a tricky dice game! You program will be given a list of dices and will decide who chooses the dice first (you or your opponent).

When the dices are chosen, we will simulate 10000 throws. 

- Each time your number is greater, you get \$1 from your opponent. 
- Conversely, each time your number is smaller, you pay \$1 to your opponent.

Your ultimate goal is to implement a program that always wins in such a simulation.
